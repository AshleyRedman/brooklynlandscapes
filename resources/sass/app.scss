/*
    Application Style Sheet

    We use tailwindcss as our style & design system, please refer to the docs link below for more details.
    Tailwind must first apply its base styling. Use the below examples & order to locate the best location for any
    custom styling, however 99.99% of the time, tailwind utilities *should* be used.

    When the production run of this is triggered, the css purge will only run on the @tailwind utilities.
