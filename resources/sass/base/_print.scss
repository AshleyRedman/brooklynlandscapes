    The @charset CSS at-rule specifies the character encoding used in
     the style sheet. It must be the first element in the style sheet 
     and not be preceded by any character; as it is not a nested statement,
     it cannot be used inside conditional group at-rules. If several @charset
      at-rules are defined, only the first one is used, and it cannot be 
      used inside a style attribute on an HTML element or inside the <style> 
      element where the character set of the HTML page is relevant.

        The @page CSS at-rule is used to modify some CSS properties 
        when printing a document. You can't change all CSS properties 
        with @page. You can only change the margins, orphans, widows, 
        and page breaks of the document. Attempts to change any other 
        CSS properties will be ignored.
